# The emsdk submodule stays pristine: it only supplies the installer scripts
# and the pinned release list ("latest" resolves against the list checked
# into the pinned submodule commit). Installs are keyed by host OS because
# the toolchain binaries are platform-specific: one working tree may be
# shared across operating systems (WSL, devcontainers), and a single shared
# install would be clobbered on every switch.
#
# The zig web build (build.zig) bootstraps the same layout automatically;
# this script exists for the CMake-only flow (CI and local presets). On
# Windows, bootstrap through `zig build -Dtarget=wasm32-emscripten` instead.
